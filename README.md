# Weather-App-v2

## Built using MVVM Architecture.
## Beginners app

## To use the app, you will need an "{ API KEY }" from openweathermap.org
### Replace "{ API KEY }" with your API key

### Finished the weather app to an extent.
### Displays static data when not connected to the internet
### Displays current weather data and weather data over five days
### Displays data for only one city: "OSOSO, NG" because the location is hardcoded in the app
#### To change the location, it will have to be done in code



### Working on setting a search field and choice of location in anywhere in the world.


### One step at a time. 


## Still new to iOS Development. This is me documenting my journey ☺️
